Helps you catch the next ferry in Amsterdam.

## Scripts

- `build` cleans and then builds app completely and outputs it to `dist` directory
- `clean` removes `build` and `dist` directories
- `format` formats code using eslint and Prettier
- `lint` lints code using eslint and Prettier
- `start:build` runs app from `dist` directory, generated by `build`
- `start` runs app for development, reloading on file changes
- `watch` compiles TypeScript and outputs JavaScript to `build` directory, updating on file changes

There also some more specialized scripts like `lint:eslint`.
Please see `package.json` for a complete list.

## Scrape

To scrape the timetables from the `gvb.nl` API run:

```bash
node scripts/scrape.js
```

This caches API responses in the `scrape-cache` directory.
If you wish to fetch fresh responses then you can remove this before running the script.

Finally, the responses are summarized and a `components/lazy-ferry/src/journeys.js` module is generated.
